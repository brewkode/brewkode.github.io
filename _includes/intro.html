    <p class="lead">Hi, I'm Sriram Ramachandrasekaran, currently based out of Seattle, WA, with roots from Chennai, India. Apart from writing code to foot my bills, I do it to get some adrenaline going. I started leaning towards code just around the time I graduated and started loving it. I love to observe, apply & validate those observations in my life. I currently ship code at <a class="indix" href="https://www.indix.com">Avalara</a>.</p> <br/> <br/>
