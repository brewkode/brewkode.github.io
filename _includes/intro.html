    <p class="lead">Hi, I'm Sriram Ramachandrasekaran. Apart from writing code to foot my bills, I do it to get some adrenaline going. I'm not your coding freak from 7th grade nor did I dabble with archaic systems at my young age. I started leaning towards code just around the time I graduated and I started loving it. I love to observe, apply & validate those observations in my life. I'm from Chennai, India and I currently ship code at <a class="indix" href="https://www.indix.com">Indix</a>.</p>
