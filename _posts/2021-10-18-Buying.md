Inspired by a couple of tweets, here goes...

Buying a book does not give you the insights,

Buying a gym/nutrition plan does not give you health,

Buying a house does not give you a home,

Buying a car does not take you places,

Buying a toaster does not give you breakfast,

Buying a thing does not give you the "thing" that you bought it for.



Doing does. Start doing.
